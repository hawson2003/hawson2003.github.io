I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), majoring in [Business Analytics](https://ug.hkubs.hku.hk/programme/bba-ba) and Computer Science. My academic interests lie in computer graphics and data analytics, and I am currently conducting research on topics within these fields.

I am actively seeking internship and research opportunities in related areas. If you would like to learn more about my qualifications and experience, please feel free to email me for a detailed resume.

My primary working languages are Mandarin Chinese and English. I also have some proficiency in Japanese, Tibetan, and Cantonese. Feel free to communicate with me in these languages — I’d be happy to practice!
