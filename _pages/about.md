I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), majoring in [Business Analytics](https://ug.hkubs.hku.hk/programme/bba-ba) and Computer Science. My academic interests lie in computer graphics and data analytics, and I am currently conducting research on topics within these fields.

I am actively seeking internship opportunities in related areas. If you would like to learn more about my qualifications and experience, please feel free to email me for a detailed resume.
